# SpaceX-Falcon-9-Project
This project is to showcase compentency in the Data Analysis pipeline from collection to predictive models using SpaceX Falcon 9's historical launch data.

## **Breakdown of each notebook in /Colab_Notebooks:**
__All notebooks have a Colab link to interact and make adjustments if you would like to gain a deeper understanding of our project.__

**1:** Data collection and preprocessing. Used the SpaceX API to collect preliminary data.

**2:** Web Scraping process. Web scraped Wiki pages to gather historical data about SpaceX launches and landings.

**3:** Data Wrangling. Normalized and breakdown dataset into most valuable datapoints and features

**4:** SQL Analysis. Gain deeper understanding of our data using SQL and drill down methods

**5:** Data Visualization. Visualize our data using various plotting methods and Seaborn/Matplotlib

**6:** Map Launchsites. Created interactive map with Folium for each launch site, including launch status. 

**7:** Dashboard. Create interactive dashboard using Dash to display visualized data in a dynamic manner.

**8:** Machine Learning Models. Create various machine learning models to predict the outcome of future launches. 

## **Libraries and Technologies used**
_Python_

- Numpy

- Matplotlib
  
- Plotly

- Folium

- Sklearn

- Seaborn

- Dash

_SQL in Python_

API calls and web scraping from Wikipeia. 

## **Executive Summary of findings**

Our findings reveal that Number of Flights plays a significant role in determining landing success, with more launches being associated with more successful re-entries. Over the past decade, the overall success rate of SpaceX flights has steadily improved. Specifically, launches targeting orbits such as ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO demonstrate the highest probability of successful landings. Additionally, launches from CCAFS SLC-40 emerged as the most reliable in terms of landing success.
